# SciOS: Advancing Open Science Infrastructure

 - *Homepage*: [Link](https://www.scios.tech/)

## Mission and Core Objectives

SciOS is a collaborative organization with a mission to “advance infrastructure”
for the scientific community. Its core objective is to coordinate people and
organizations in building sustainable scientific infrastructure, “coordination
layers, and operating systems for the scientific endeavor”.

## Key Projects and Programs

While still a young organization, SciOS has launched and supported several
projects and events.

### SciOS Workshops

SciOS Workshops are structured, outcome-focused gatherings that aim to improve
the infrastructure and coordination mechanisms supporting open science. These
workshops bring together researchers, engineers, and stakeholders from various
disciplines to address challenges related to scientific data management,
reproducibility, collaboration, and technology adoption. Rather than traditional
academic conferences, SciOS Workshops focus on practical development, where
participants work on defining problems, building prototype solutions, and
refining approaches for more effective scientific workflows.  

One of the primary goals of these workshops is to facilitate cross-disciplinary
collaboration between open-science communities, developers, and institutions
working on decentralized research tools, FAIR (Findable, Accessible,
Interoperable, Reusable) data standards, and open source infrastructure. The
workshops typically produce tangible outputs, such as frameworks, protocols, or
software tools, rather than reports or policy recommendations. The 2024 workshop
series, titled *"Science Needs a Firmware Update"*, was part of the broader
DeSci Summit and focused on identifying technical and cultural barriers to more
open and reproducible research practices. By convening participants from both
academic and technology backgrounds, SciOS Workshops aim to bridge gaps in the
scientific ecosystem and accelerate the development of shared infrastructure for
modern research.

### Supported projects

- **Automating Metadata**: Developing tools to streamline the generation and management of research metadata.
- **Research Assessment**: Creating frameworks to evaluate research outputs more effectively.
- **Open Source Permanent Versionable Containers and Attestation Platform**: Building a platform for secure, version-controlled research environments.
- **Open Source Security Dashboard**: Enhancing the security of open source scientific tools and infrastructure.
- **Project Interop**: Seeks to implement FAIR principles across industry and academia.
